# Sojourner

## Description

- We built this app as a travel planning utility and fun social hangout.

- This app will save users time and data by having one catch-all app where they can see upcoming trips and share travel information and invite friends.

- Our team learned a ton about React components and React routing!  We also learned about using GraphQL which enables some unique queries and quick loading simply designed apps.  Gained exposure to openAI API.
